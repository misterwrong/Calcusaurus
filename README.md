# The Calcusaurus - A group of dinos does calculation exercises with you!

I wrote this for my five year old son whom I first showed some calculation exercises on an MSX 
emulator. He seemed to like it but the interface was a bit more cumbersome than it would have been
on real hardware, so I decided I would write something myself.

There is of course plenty of software for this specific purpose available, for tablets, phones or even
actual computers, all really colourful and probably very pedagogically responsible. However, even when they don't 
explicitely ask for permission to use the devices' front camera and mic, you still need an account and 
you can be sure there is a company slowly building a detailed profile of your kids.

So, this just works in Java (which you most likely already have on your computer). It runs on your
computer's desktop, and no internet connection is needed to run it. You also need no account or 
anything else. You just tell it what kind of exercises you want and there you go.

Have fun!

* Internationalize (All texts are in Dutch)
* Ask for 0, < 0, > 10, > 100
